    This plugin's goal is to simplify the deployment of a grails application to a cluster consisting of multiple tomcat instances
and an Apache httpd mod_proxy_balancer.<p class="paragraph"/>It assumes you have an <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.1/mod/mod_proxy_balancer.html" target="blank">Apache mod_proxy_balancer</a> running in front of multiple tomcat instances in order to
provide a) high-availability and b) load-balancing to your Grails application. In such a scenario, upgrading the running
application to a newer release is painful. This plugin's goal is to simplify that procedure by performing a
"rolling upgrade". Calling 'grails tomcat redeploy' performs these actions:
<ol>
<li>take first node offline in loadbalancer</li>
<li>undeploy app on first tomcat node</li>
<li>deploy app on first tomcat node</li>
<li>check if app responds on first tomcat node</li>
<li>take first node online in loadbalancer</li>
<li>proceed the same procedure with next node</li>
</ol><p class="paragraph"/>Since Grails 1.3.2 the tomcat plugin is capable of
<ol>
<li>deploying to multiple hosts and</li>
<li>emitting lifecycle events: PreDeploy, PostDeploy, PreUndeploy, PostUndeploy</li>
</ol><p class="paragraph"/>By catching up these events it is simple possible to remote control the loadbalancer. mod_proxy_balancer comes with a
simple management frontend called balancer-manager. This consists of some simple HTML forms that can be easily
triggered using htmlunit.<p class="paragraph"/>This plugin was invented on the Hackergarden event at gr8conf 2010 in Copenhagen and finished the weekend afterwards.
Thanks to Canoo for sponsoring pizza and drinks.<p class="paragraph"/>The plugin is licensend under the <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/" target="blank">WTFPL</a>.<p class="paragraph"/>
